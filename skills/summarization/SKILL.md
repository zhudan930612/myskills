# Summarization

## Purpose

Create effective summaries by matching summarization type to purpose, audience, and context. "Summarize" can mean many different things—this skill helps identify and execute the right approach.

## Core Principle

**Summarization is translation, not just reduction.** Different purposes require different summary types. Clarify the need before condensing.

## Clarifying Questions

Before summarizing, consider:

1. **Purpose:** What will this summary be used for?
   - Decision-making
   - Background information
   - Further research
   - Quick understanding
   - Reference/recall

2. **Audience:** Who will read it?
   - Technical experts
   - General audience
   - Decision makers
   - Familiar/unfamiliar with topic

3. **Scope:** How comprehensive?
   - Ultra-brief (single sentence)
   - Brief (paragraph)
   - Moderate (page)
   - Extended (multiple pages)

4. **Emphasis:** What aspects are most important?
   - Methodology
   - Findings/results
   - Arguments/claims
   - Context/background
   - Implications/applications

5. **Format:** What structure?
   - Narrative text
   - Bullet points
   - Hierarchical outline
   - Visual representation

## Summary Type Taxonomy

### Information Reduction Approaches

| Type | What It Is | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Key Point Extraction** | Isolating the most important claims | Original has discrete important points |
| **Abstraction** | Higher-level statements covering multiple details | Patterns matter more than specifics |
| **Gisting** | Capturing essential meaning, discarding details | Only core message matters |
| **Compression** | Shortening while preserving information | Comprehensive coverage needed in less space |

### Structural Approaches

| Type | What It Is | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Executive Summary** | Business-focused: decisions, recommendations, outcomes | Documents requiring action |
| **Abstract/Précis** | Academic: methodology and findings | Research papers, technical documents |
| **TLDR** | Ultra-brief main takeaway | Casual communication, extreme brevity |
| **Outline** | Hierarchical structure of main/supporting points | Logical structure matters |

### Purpose-Oriented Approaches

| Type | What It Is | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Synthesis** | Combining multiple sources coherently | Summarizing across documents |
| **Critical Summary** | Evaluating claims while condensing | Assessment of quality needed |
| **Contextual Summary** | Framing within broader knowledge | Understanding bigger picture matters |
| **Actionable Summary** | Focusing on implications and next steps | Summary will drive action |

## Execution by Type

### Key Point Extraction
1. Scan for topic sentences and conclusions
2. Identify explicitly stated main ideas
3. List each distinct point
4. Preserve original phrasing where powerful

**Example:** "The author makes three main arguments: (1)..., (2)..., (3)..."

### Abstraction
1. Group related details
2. Find common themes or patterns
3. Create higher-level statements
4. Reduce specifics to principles

**Example:** "Multiple studies consistently show..." instead of listing 12 studies

### Gisting
1. Ask: "What is the one thing to remember?"
2. Distill to core insight
3. Remove all supporting detail
4. Verify essence is preserved

**Example:** "Remote work increases productivity for most knowledge workers."

### Executive Summary
1. State the problem/opportunity
2. Present the solution/recommendation
3. Highlight key benefits
4. Note costs/risks
5. Specify required actions

### Synthesis
1. Read all sources
2. Identify common themes
3. Note contradictions
4. Find complementary information
5. Create unified narrative

**Example:** "Across the five reports, three key trends emerge..."

### Critical Summary
1. Summarize the claims
2. Evaluate the evidence
3. Assess methodology
4. Note limitations
5. Conclude with assessment

**Example:** "While the author claims X, the evidence is limited by..."

## Format Variations

### Quotation-Based
- Use key phrases verbatim
- When precise wording is important
- Select and organize most important quotes

### Bullet Points
- Break continuous text into discrete units
- When quick scanning is valued
- Make each point standalone

### Progressive Summary
- Start ultra-brief
- Add layers of detail
- Let reader choose depth

### Comparative Summary
- Side-by-side analysis
- Highlight similarities and differences
- When contrasting sources

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Purpose is clear
- [ ] Audience is considered
- [ ] Scope is appropriate
- [ ] Emphasis matches needs
- [ ] Format serves purpose
- [ ] Core message is preserved
- [ ] Reduction is proportional
- [ ] No invented information
- [ ] Attribution where needed

## Anti-Patterns

### The Information Dump
**Problem:** Reduces length but not complexity
**Fix:** Focus on what matters, not just what's short

### The Distortion
**Problem:** Changes meaning through compression
**Fix:** Verify summary against original claims

### The One-Size-Fits-All
**Problem:** Same approach for all requests
**Fix:** Match type to purpose and audience

### The Over-Abstraction
**Problem:** Loses all useful specifics
**Fix:** Preserve concrete details that support understanding

## Integration Points

**Inbound:**
- When asked to summarize any content
- When processing long documents
- When creating documentation

**Outbound:**
- To decision-making processes
- To knowledge management systems
- To communication outputs

**Complementary:**
- `speech-adaptation`: For spoken summaries
- `voice-analysis`: For maintaining voice in summaries
