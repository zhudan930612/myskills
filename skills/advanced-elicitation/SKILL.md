# Advanced Elicitation

## Overview

Meta-cognitive reasoning applied to AI outputs. Makes AI reconsider its own work through 15+ systematic methods.

**Core Principle**: First-pass responses are often good but not great. Elicitation forces deeper thinking.

## When to Use

**Use when:**

- Making important decisions (architecture, security, major features)
- Solving complex problems (multiple stakeholders, unclear requirements)
- Producing critical outputs (specs, plans, designs)
- Quality matters more than speed

**Don't use when:**

- Simple queries ("What is X?")
- Routine tasks (formatting, simple refactoring)
- Time-sensitive (emergency fixes)
- Budget-constrained (2x cost)

## How It Works

1. **Generate Initial Response**: Agent produces first-pass answer
2. **Apply Elicitation Method**: Pick 1-3 methods based on context
3. **Reconsider**: Agent re-evaluates using method
4. **Synthesize**: Combine insights, produce improved output

## Elicitation Methods

### 1. First Principles Thinking

**Description**: Break down to fundamental truths, rebuild reasoning from ground up

**When to Use**:

- Complex system design
- Architecture decisions
- Innovation challenges

**Prompt Template**:

---
{content}
---

Steps:
1. List all underlying assumptions
2. Question each assumption: "Is this fundamentally true?"
3. Identify fundamental truths (cannot be broken down further)
4. Rebuild solution from fundamentals only
5. Compare rebuilt solution to original - what changed?

Output:
### First Principles Analysis

**Fundamental Truths:**
- [Truth 1]

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Method (Quick)

```javascript
Skill({ skill: 'advanced-elicitation', args: 'first-principles' });
```

### Pattern 2: Multiple Methods (Thorough)

```javascript
Skill({ skill: 'advanced-elicitation', args: 'first-principles,pre-mortem,red-team-blue-team' });
```

### Pattern 3: Auto-Select (Recommended)

```javascript
Skill({ skill: 'advanced-elicitation', args: 'auto' });
// Automatically picks 2-3 methods based on content analysis
```

## Integration with spec-critique

Advanced Elicitation can enhance spec-critique:

```javascript
// After generating spec
Skill({ skill: 'spec-critique', args: 'with-elicitation' });
// Applies elicitation to critique process
```

## Cost Control (per ADR-053)

- **Opt-in only**: Never applied automatically
- **Budget limit**: Configurable via ELICITATION_BUDGET_LIMIT
- **Cost tracking**: Integrates with cost-tracking hook

**Config**:

```yaml
features:
  advancedElicitation:
    enabled: true
    costBudget: 10.0 # USD per session
    minConfidence: 0.7 # Skip if confidence high
    maxMethodsPerInvocation: 5 # SEC-AE-001
    maxInvocationsPerSession: 10 # SEC-AE-003
```

## Security Controls

**SEC-AE-001: Input Validation**

- Method names must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`
- Max 5 methods per invocation
- Invalid methods rejected with error

**SEC-AE-002: Cost Budget Enforcement**

- Check session budget before elicitation
- Track cumulative cost
- Fail gracefully if budget exceeded

**SEC-AE-003: Rate Limiting**

- Max 10 elicitations per session
- Prevent runaway elicitation loops
- Clear error message on limit

## Examples

### Example 1: Architecture Decision

**Before Elicitation:**

```
We should use microservices with 12 services communicating via REST.
```

**After First Principles:**

```
Fundamental truths: Services must communicate, data must be consistent.
Challenged assumption: "12 services" - is this the right granularity?
Could 6 bounded contexts suffice?

Improvement: Consolidate to 6-8 services by bounded context.
Use gRPC internally (40% latency reduction vs REST).
```

### Example 2: Security Review

**Before Elicitation:**

```
JWT tokens for authentication across services.
```

**After Red Team/Blue Team:**

```
Red Team Attack: Token theft via XSS, JWT validation on every call (latency).
Blue Team Defense: HttpOnly cookies, service mesh mTLS instead of JWT propagation.

Improvement: Use service mesh (Istio) for security instead of JWT propagation.
```

### Example 3: Spec Validation

**Before Elicitation:**

```
Feature: User can delete their account.
```

**After Pre-Mortem:**

```
Failure Scenario: 6 months later, GDPR compliance audit fails.
Cause: Deletion didn't cascade to all systems (analytics, backups).

Improvement: Add "Data Retention Audit" requirement.
Specify cascade delete to all systems within 30 days.
```

## Performance

- **Quality Improvement**: +30% (measured on critical decisions)
- **Cost**: 2x LLM usage
- **Time**: +50% (worth it for important work)

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**

```bash
cat .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
```

**After completing:**

- New pattern → `.claude/context/memory/learnings.md`
- Issue found → `.claude/context/memory/issues.md`
- Decision made → `.claude/context/memory/decisions.md`

> ASSUME INTERRUPTION: If it's not in memory, it didn't happen.

## Iron Laws

1. **NEVER apply elicitation automatically** — it is always opt-in. Never invoke without explicit user request or clear agent intent signal.
2. **ALWAYS emit a confidence level** for every method output — `HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW` is mandatory. Outputs without calibration are not actionable.
3. **NEVER exceed 5 methods per invocation** (SEC-AE-001) — over-elicitation produces noise, not signal. Select 1-3 most relevant methods.
4. **ALWAYS check session budget** before invoking — fail gracefully with a clear message when `ELICITATION_BUDGET_LIMIT` is exceeded (SEC-AE-002).
5. **NEVER treat elicitation as a substitute for evidence** — it refines reasoning; it does not produce facts. Always ground conclusions in codebase evidence.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                     | Why It Fails                                  | Correct Approach                                         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-applying to every response  | 2× cost with no benefit for simple tasks      | Opt-in only for important/complex decisions              |
| Running all 15 methods at once   | Diminishing returns, token explosion          | Select 1–3 most relevant methods                         |
| Skipping confidence rating       | Evaluation without calibration is useless     | Always emit `**Confidence Level:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW`      |
| Elicitation replaces evidence    | Reasoning without facts is speculation        | Pair with grounded codebase evidence before eliciting    |
| No budget check                  | Session cost spirals undetected               | Always verify `ELICITATION_BUDGET_LIMIT` before invoking |
| Running after deadline/emergency | High cost with no time to act on improvements | Skip for time-critical fixes; use for strategic work     |
